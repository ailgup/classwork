# Classwork
## C++
Coursework from Northeastern University

These are projects completed as part of EECE 2560: Fundamentals of Engineering Algorithms.
They are all written in C++, some of the latter programs require the Boost Graph Libaray to be installed

##Java
Random Java musings from High School and beyond, everything vry experimental, code is probably poorly written and documented even more poorly.
